##Security Incident Response Playbook for GCP API Key Compromise##

  #Step 1: Initial Response
    #Confirmation of Incident:

    #Verify the authenticity of the incident through initial logs or alerts related to the compromised key.
    #Disable or Delete the Compromised GCP API Key to prevent further unauthorized access

gcloud iam service-accounts keys disable COMPROMISED_KEY_ID --iam-account SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL

  #Create new keys for the service account and update applications accordingly:

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create --iam-account SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL NEW_KEY.json

    #add new key to Secret Manager 

gcloud secrets create [SECRET_NAME] --replication-policy="automatic"
gcloud secrets versions add [SECRET_NAME] --data-file=[KEY_FILE].json


  #Step 2: Investigation

  #Determining the Compromise Timeline:

    #Use Stackdriver Logging to query for log entries associated with the compromised key:

gcloud logging read "protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail='SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL' AND protoPayload.authenticationInfo.authoritySelector='COMPROMISED_KEY_ID'" --limit 1 --format 'value(timestamp)'

    #Query Stackdriver Logging for API calls made using the compromised key:

gcloud logging read "protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail='SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL' AND protoPayload.authenticationInfo.authoritySelector='COMPROMISED_KEY_ID'" --format 'value(protoPayload.resourceName)'

    #Check for IAM Resource Creation:

gcloud logging read "protoPayload.serviceName='iam.googleapis.com' AND protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail='SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL' AND protoPayload.authenticationInfo.authoritySelector='COMPROMISED_KEY_ID' AND (protoPayload.methodName:'CreateServiceAccount' OR protoPayload.methodName:'CreateRole')" --format 'value(protoPayload.methodName, protoPayload.resourceName)'

  #Step 4: Communication and Documentation
    #Incident Reporting:
    #Document the incident details, actions taken, resources accessed, and any remediation steps.
    #Notify relevant stakeholders or authorities about the incident and actions taken.
