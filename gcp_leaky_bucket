##Incident Response Playbook: GCP Misconfigured Bucket Allowing Public Read##

  #1. Initial Response and Assessment
    #Identify the misconfigured GCS bucket and the Data Classification Type contained.
    #Log the detection time and actions taken.

  #2. Communication
    #Notify relevant team members and management.
    #Prepare external stakeholder communication without revealing sensitive details.

  #3. Investigation and Assessment of Access

    #Enable Access Logging on the Bucket (if not already enabled):

gsutil mb -l [BUCKET_LOCATION] gs://[LOG_BUCKET]
gsutil acl ch -g cloud-storage-analytics@google.com:W gs://[LOG_BUCKET]
gsutil logging set on -b gs://[LOG_BUCKET] -o [LOG_OBJECT_PREFIX] gs://[MISCONFIGURED_BUCKET]

    #If Access Logs were ON BEFORE the Incident, Download access logs:

gsutil cp gs://[LOG_BUCKET]/[LOG_OBJECT_PREFIX]* .

    #If Access logs were NOT on before the Incident

gcloud logging read "resource.type=gcs_bucket AND resource.labels.bucket_name=[BUCKET_NAME] AND timestamp>='[START_TIME]' AND timestamp<='[END_TIME]'" --limit [NUMBER_OF_ENTRIES] --format=json

    #Use log analysis tools to parse and inspect the access logs for read events, including timestamps and, if available, IP addresses.

  #4. Lock Down the Bucket

gsutil iam ch allUsers:None gs://[MISCONFIGURED_BUCKET]
gsutil defacl set private gs://[MISCONFIGURED_BUCKET]

  #5. Document and Communicate INC as per Company Policy per Data Classification Type
